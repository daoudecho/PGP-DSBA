### Project steps:

Experience end-to-end problem solving using a combination of tools and techniques in analytics. Learn practical implementation of various analytical techniques and choose the one which gives results most appropriate for business Understand the trade-offs that need to be made when solving a problem in real life. Develop better presentation and report writing skills.

1-Introduction: Define the problem statement, need of the present study and business/social opportunity

2-Data Report Understand how data was collected in terms of time, frequency, methodology Visual inspection of data (rows, columns, descriptive details) Understanding of attributes (variable info, renaming if required)

3-Initial Exploratory Data Analysis Univariate analysis (distribution and spread for every continuous attribute, distribution of the data in categories for categorical ones) Bivariate analysis (relationship between different variables, correlations)

4-Data pre-processing Removal of unwanted variables Missing Value Treatment Data split into test and train Outlier treatment Variable Transformation Addition of New variables

5-Exploratory Data Analysis Relationship among variables, important variables (after data pre-processing) Insightful visualizations

6-Analytical Approach (mention the alternative analytical approaches that you may see fit to be applied to the problem)

7-Modelling Process (validation & interpretation) Model comparisons (confusion matrix, ROC, AUC, SSE whichever is applicable) Ensemble modelling, wherever applicable Interpretation from the best model

8-Business insights

### Domain

we used Falcon airlines data to understand which parameters important to ‘satisfied’ passenger, after data process and good fit model that solves the problem by using a combination of tools and techniques in analytics with most appropriate for business, also portion of the population rate should be targeted to get the highest response rate, also classify satisfied customer with accuracy 96.31%

### Skills and Tools

R, Random Forest, Classification, Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis

### Conclusion

after analytics and modeling the most important variables for satisfaction are: "entertainment" and "Seat_comfort", random forest had the best accurate 96.31% for classify satisfied customer also target the right portion population size for marketing campaigns and ads click to get the maximum response rate of 98%.
