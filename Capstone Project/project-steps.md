OBJECTIVE

Experience end-to-end problem solving using a combination of tools and techniques in analytics.
Learn practical implementation of various analytical techniques and choose the one which gives results most appropriate for business
Understand the trade-offs that need to be made when solving a problem in real life.
Develop better presentation and report writing skills.

1-Introduction: Define the problem statement, need of the present study and business/social opportunity

2-Data Report
Understand how data was collected in terms of time, frequency, methodology
Visual inspection of data (rows, columns, descriptive details)
Understanding of attributes (variable info, renaming if required)

3-Initial Exploratory Data Analysis
Univariate analysis (distribution and spread for every continuous attribute, distribution of the data in categories for categorical ones)
Bivariate analysis (relationship between different variables, correlations)

4-Data pre-processing
Removal of unwanted variables
Missing Value Treatment
Data split into test and train
Outlier treatment
Variable Transformation
Addition of New variables

5-Exploratory Data Analysis
Relationship among variables, important variables (after data pre-processing)
Insightful visualizations

6-Analytical Approach (mention the alternative analytical approaches that you may see fit to be applied to the problem)

7-Modelling Process (validation & interpretation)
Model comparisons (confusion matrix, ROC, AUC, SSE whichever is applicable)
Ensemble modelling, wherever applicable
Interpretation from the best model

8-Business insights
